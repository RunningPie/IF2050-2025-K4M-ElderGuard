# GitHub Actions workflow for a Java Gradle project
# This workflow builds the project, runs tests, and creates a distributable package.
name: ElderGuard CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events for the main and develop branches
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events for the main and develop branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up Java Development Kit (JDK) 21
      - name: Set up JDK 21 with Gradle Cache
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '21'
          # Caches Gradle dependencies for faster subsequent builds
          cache: 'gradle'

      # Step 3: Sets up environment variables from secrets for the build process
      - name: Set up environment variables
        run: echo "SUPABASE_DB_URL=${{ secrets.SUPABASE_DB_URL }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      # Step 4: Grants execute permission to the Gradle wrapper script
      - name: Grant execute permission for Gradle
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # Step 5: Builds the project using the Gradle wrapper
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew build --no-daemon

      # Step 6: Runs the tests using the Gradle wrapper
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./gradlew test --no-daemon

      # Step 7: Builds a "fat JAR" that includes all dependencies
      - name: Build fat JAR
        run: ./gradlew shadowJar

      # Step 8: Creates launcher scripts and .env file with embedded secrets.
      # This provides two ways for the app to get the DB URL: env variable or .env file.
